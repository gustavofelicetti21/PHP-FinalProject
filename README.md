That project was the final project for the Programming II course in the computer technical program in 2023.
I completed the course at the "Instituto Federal Catarinense," at the Videira campus, where I also attended high school with an integrated technical course.
In Programming II, during the third year of high school, we learned the PHP language.

The project is an e-commerce site for a geek store, and I developed the front end using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5, while the back end was built with PHP. A little JavaScript was also used in the project.
For the database, I used MySQL on my localhost.
The site is partially responsive, and I want to update it to be as responsive as possible and to fix some visual and programming bugs. 
To access the website, it is necessary to import the .sql file into MySQL and change the PDO in the file "\admin\src\ConexaoBD.php" to see the registered products.
